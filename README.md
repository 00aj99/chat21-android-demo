# Chat21 SDK Demo 

## Add Chat21 SDK to your project

Follow the [readme](https://github.com/chat21/android-sdk/blob/0.10.x/README.md) to add the Chat21 SDK to your project 

## Limitations

This sample project uses fake users that do not have real authentication.

For this reason, in the demo, it is ***not*** possible:

- send pictures
- send / receive push notifications

However, image forwarding and push notifications ***are supported*** with real users.
