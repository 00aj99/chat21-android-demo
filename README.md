## add Chat21 SDK to project

Follow the [readme]() to add the Chat21 SDK to your project 

## Limitations

This [sample project](https://github.com/chat21/chat21-android-demo)  uses fake users that do not have real authentication.

For this reason, in the demo, it is ***not*** possible:

- send pictures
- send / receive push notifications

However, image forwarding and push notifications ***are supported*** with real users.
